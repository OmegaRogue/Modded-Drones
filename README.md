# Modded-Drones
Repository for sharing Nimbatus Drones made with [Nimbatus-Mods](https://github.com/OmegaRogue/Nimbatus-Mods)

## Getting Started

If you make a Drone with OmegaMod, you probably shouldn't share it on the Steam Workshop, so Upload your Drone Files here!

### Branches

If your Drone is for general use, upload it to the branch [General](https://github.com/OmegaRogue/Modded-Drones/tree/General)

If your Drone is for Sumo, first of all, **DON'T** use them in the Sumo Arena. You should uplod it to the branch [Sumo](https://github.com/OmegaRogue/Modded-Drones/tree/Sumo)

If your Drone is for Racing, upload it to the branch [Racing](https://github.com/OmegaRogue/Modded-Drones/tree/Racing)
